  <h2>0. Introduction</h2>
    <strong>Environment</strong>
    I have tested these programs in the following environment: The OS is Windows 11 23H2 (OS build 22631.4112), which is a 64-bit operating system.
    The application used to test implemented codes operates as a 32-bit application within the WOW64 (Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit) environment, and our code has been optimized accordingly.
