  <h2>0. Introduction</h2>
    This article introduces methods for using certain Windows API functions from Python, which are useful for creating extensions for applications running on Windows whose source code is not available.
    Windows API (also commonly known as Win32 API) is a collection of DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) that provide an interface for accessing Windows functionality.
    The diverse functionalities of the Windows API include connecting to a running application (process), reading from and writing to its memory space, detecting access to specific memory regions, and intervening in the processing of threads within the process.
    By utilizing these functions, it becomes possible to provide extensions such as recording the application's operational state over time or dynamically modifying its behavior (albeit in a limited manner) without accessing its source code.
    The functionalities of the Windows API can be accessed from Python through ctypes, a standard Python library.
    In this article, building on the background outlined above, I aim to share insights and Python code to assist those with similar goals.

    <h6>Environment</h6>
    I have tested these programs in the following environment: The OS is Windows 11 23H2 (OS build 22631.4112), which is a 64-bit operating system.
    The application used to test the implemented code operates as a 32-bit application within the WOW64 (Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit), and my code has been optimized accordingly.
    The processor used is an Intel Core i5-12400.
    Python version is 3.12.6.

  <h2>1. Reading Memory</h2>
    The following script (memory_reader.py) defines functions to obtain the process ID or handle of a running process, enumerate the memory regions used by that process, and read specified memory regions.
