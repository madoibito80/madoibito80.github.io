  <h2>0. Introduction</h2>
    This article introduces methods for using certain Windows API functions from Python, which are useful for creating extensions for applications running on Windows whose source code is not available.
    Windows API (also commonly known as Win32 API) is a collection of DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) that provide an interface for accessing Windows functionality.
    The diverse functionalities of the Windows API include connecting to a running application (process), reading from and writing to its memory space, detecting access to specific memory regions, and intervening in the processing of threads within the process.
    By utilizing these functions, it is possible to implement extensions, such as recording the application's state over time or dynamically modifying its behavior (albeit in a limited manner), without accessing its source code.
    The functionalities of the Windows API can be accessed from Python through ctypes, a standard Python library.
    In this article, building on the background outlined above, I aim to share insights and Python code to assist those with similar goals.

    <h6>Environment</h6>
    I have tested these programs in the following environment: The OS is Windows 11 23H2 (OS build 22631.4112), which is x64-based.
    The application used to test the implemented code operates as a 32-bit application within the WOW64 (Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit), and my code has been optimized accordingly.
    More precisely, the definitions of certain structures and the functions used differ when analyzing 64-bit applications.
    Python version is 3.12.6.

  <h2>1. Reading Memory</h2>
    The following script (<code>memory_reader.py</code>) defines functions to obtain the process ID or handle of a running process, enumerate the memory regions used by a process, and read specified memory regions.
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/madoibito80/c062b302b5d425a1c63e85f730a4cfb8.js?file=memory_reader.py"></script>
 
  <h2>2. Enumerating Modules</h2>
    The following script (<code>module_reader.py</code>) defines a function that enumerates the modules (e.g. .exe, .dll) loaded into memory by a process.
    It also provides example code that displays the memory regions occupied by each module.
    The memory address where a module is loaded may differ each time, but knowing the base address of a specific module enables the resolution of multi-level pointers, as described in the next section.
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/madoibito80/c062b302b5d425a1c63e85f730a4cfb8.js?file=module_reader.py"></script>
  
  <h2>3. Resolving Multi-Level Pointers</h2>
    The following script (<code>pointer_chaser.py</code>) defines a function to resolve multi-level pointers.
    The purpose of this script is to access a specific variable within a process.
    Typically, due to ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and dynamic memory allocation, the address of a variable is determined randomly.
    The simplest way to locate it is to identify a rule, such as "the variable exists at a certain offset from the base address of a specific module within the process."
    However, in practice, it is often necessary to resolve pointers hierarchically, where a pointer at a certain offset from the module's base address points to another pointer.
    <br />
    The <code>get_address_by_pointer_offsets</code> function defines the logic to resolve a pointer chain by navigating through a series of pointer offsets.
    This function takes a module name and a series of offsets, resolving the final memory address by applying each offset sequentially.
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/madoibito80/c062b302b5d425a1c63e85f730a4cfb8.js?file=pointer_chaser.py"></script>
    As an example, the above function was used to identify the address where the memory stores the player's XYZ coordinates in a game.
    The specific values of the pointer chain were identified using Cheat Engine 7.5, and the steps for this operation were guided by this <a href="https://ethical-cheats.com/03_%E3%83%9D%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%92%E4%BD%BF%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6%E3%82%A2%E3%83%89%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%A0%E5%8C%96%E3%81%AB%E5%AF%BE%E5%BF%9C/03_%E3%83%9D%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%92%E4%BD%BF%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6%E3%82%A2%E3%83%89%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%A0%E5%8C%96%E3%81%AB%E5%AF%BE%E5%BF%9C.html">blog</a>.

  <h2>4. Writing Memory</h2>
    The following script (<code>memory_writer.py</code>) defines a function that allows writing a specified value into memory.
    By using this function, you may be able to modify the behavior of a running application.
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/madoibito80/c062b302b5d425a1c63e85f730a4cfb8.js?file=memory_writer.py"></script>
  
  <h2>5. Intercepting and Modifying Memory Access</h2>
    I have previously explained how to identify the memory address where a variable is stored and how to write a new value to that address.
    But what happens if the number of bytes in the new value is greater than in the old value?
    For example, when modifying a string, if the new value (<code>$str_new</code>) is longer than the old value (<code>$str_old</code>), and another variable is stored immediately after the end of <code>$str_old</code>, the memory area of that variable may be overwritten and corrupted.
    <br />
    Here is one method to solve this problem.
    First, let's denote the starting address of <code>$str_old</code> as <code>$addr</code>.
    We define <code>memory[$addr : $addr + len($str_old)]</code> as <code>region_0</code> and <code>memory[$addr + len($str_old) : $addr + len($str_new)]</code> as <code>region_1</code>.
    If the monitored process accesses <code>region_0</code>, write <code>$str_new</code> to the combined area of <code>region_0</code> and <code>region_1</code>.
    Additionally, if <code>region_1</code> is accessed, write back the original value before <code>$str_new</code> was written.
    By repeating this procedure, the monitored process is expected to correctly access both <code>$str_new</code> and the variable in <code>region_1</code>.
    <br />
    As a preparation for introducing the code to achieve this, the necessary constants are defined in the following script (<code>const.py</code>).
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/madoibito80/c062b302b5d425a1c63e85f730a4cfb8.js?file=const.py"></script>
    Next, I will describe the following script (<code>memory_interceptor.py</code>) which implements the idea described above.
    <br />
    <code>VirtualProtectEx</code> function sets access restrictions on memory pages containing the target address and catches <code>ACCESS_VIOLATION</code> exception when access occurs.
    During exception handling, the execution of the attached process is temporarily suspended, allowing you to modify the contents of the memory in the meantime.
    <br />
    Additionally, during this exception handling, the access restriction is temporarily lifted, and the thread that caused the access is configured to report <code>WX86_SINGLE_STEP</code> exception.
    This exception occurs when a thread with a specific value set in the EFLAGS register executes a single instruction.
    <br />
    Afterward, by calling <code>ContinueDebugEvent</code> function with <code>DBG_CONTINUE</code> flag, the exception handling concludes, and the instruction is re-executed.
    During re-execution, since the access restriction on memory is lifted, the instruction that caused the exception is processed normally.
    Once the instruction completes, <code>WX86_SINGLE_STEP</code> exception is raised, and the access restriction on memory is re-applied during this exception handling.
    By repeating this procedure, it becomes possible to detect when the monitored process accesses specific memory regions and to switch the memory contents on a per-instruction basis.
    <br />
    <code>intercept_memory_access</code> function, which constitutes the loop mentioned above, automatically terminates after the timeout period from the initial memory modification.
    However, there is room for considering more efficient methods, such as terminating when a specific instruction is executed.
