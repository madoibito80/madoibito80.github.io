      100 million users accessing diverse content through the platform. (1) I was
      responsible for designing and operating a pipeline to process and store user
      interaction histories as features to deliver more relevant content to users.
      (2) Additionally, I contributed to developing machine learning models to predict
      user attributes (such as age and gender) for personalized advertising by utilizing
      these features. (3) Furthermore, I worked on improving the sticker suggestion
      feature used during message composition (suggesting stickers matching user input
      text). This involved creating an annotation tool, defining metrics for evaluating
      the suggestion feature, and building a pipeline to calculate these metrics from
      actual user logs. The following technologies were utilized in these projects:
      Python, Apache Spark, Apache Airflow, Git, Docker, and Streamlit."

    en: Reinforcement learning is advancing in applications such as robot control,
      but training robots to interact in the real world can be costly and risky. A
      solution is to operate agents in the real world that were pre-trained in simulators,
      but accurate simulators are not always available. Especially for vision-based
      agents that receive camera images as state observations, it is generally difficult
      to equip simulators with high-precision renderers. The problem of bridging the
      gap between simulators and the real world in reinforcement learning is studied
      in the field known as Sim-to-Real. We propose a method for effectively utilizing
      agents pre-trained in simulators in the real world, even under challenging conditions
      with only low-precision renderers, or sometimes even without any renderers at
      all. The paper on this study was accepted at the IJCNN, with an acceptance rate
      of 55.4% (~ 1467/2646 for IEEE WCCI).

      - Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithmically optimizes the architecture
        of deep neural networks, as the structure of a computational graph significantly
        impacts the performance of a trained model. One of the main approaches in NAS
        is gradient-based NAS, which defines differentiable architectures to simultaneously
        optimize both the architecture and weight parameters via gradient descent.
      - My first-authored paper on gradient-based NAS, which proposes a method that
        converges with fewer updates while minimizing GPU memory usage, received the
        JSAI Annual Conference Student Incentive Award in Jul. 2019 and was accepted
        at AAAI with an acceptance rate of 21.4% (1692 out of 7911).
      - I contributed to research on automatic termination for gradient-based NAS, which
        exploits an upper bound on the decay of generalization error to determine when
        to stop the search process.
